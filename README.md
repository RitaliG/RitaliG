### Hi there! 👋
#### I am Ritali Ghosh, a graduate student in the Joint Astronomy and Astrophysics Programme at the Department of Physics, *Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore*, working with Prof. Prateek Sharma.  :snowflake:
- 🔭 I am a computational astrophysicist working with idealized simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.
- 🌱 I am especially interested in understanding the evolution of the *circumgalactic medium* (CGM) -- the diffuse, extended reservoir of plasma that permeates the space beyond the galaxy's disk and extends far up to its virial radius.
