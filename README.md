#### I am a graduate student at the *Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore*. I joined the Joint Astronomy and Astrophysics Programme at IISc in 2019. I am a computational astrophysicist employing idealized simulations to understand the evolution of the *circumgalactic medium* (CGM) -- the diffuse plasma that permeates the space beyond the galaxy's disk and extends far up to its virial radius. :snowflake:🔭
