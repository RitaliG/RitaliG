### Hi there! 👋
#### I am Ritali Ghosh, a graduate student at the *Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore*. I joined the *Joint Astronomy and Astrophysics Programme* at IISc in 2019. I am working with *Prof. Prateek Sharma*, on understanding the evolution of the *circumgalactic medium* (CGM) -- the diffuse plasma that permeates the space beyond the galaxy's disk and extends far up to its virial radius. :snowflake:
- 🔭 I am a computational astrophysicist working with idealized simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.
